## Getting Started with Random Code Developer

This program exists to support a user who is looking to retrieve a particular park code from a list of parks.

## Why this Project Matters 

Thhis project enables a separate web application to do the work it needs to do by providing both an on screen button page, but also returning a value for the other application to use. The on screen button page validates the value which is otherwise hidden.

## Important Information

The following endpoint should be used for the fetch request and running the micros service locally: http://localhost:3000/ 

The park codes can be found at this location: http://localhost:4000

The user should first run the microservice file and then run the react application. I advise changing app.JS into a separate page within your application to maintain button functionality. This is not mandatory though :)
